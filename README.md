# IoT-AT&T-M2X RESTful APIs
Monitoring Raspberry PI CPU Temperature, CPU load using AT&amp;T M2X RESTful APIs
#Summary
  Its fun project to explore with AT&T iot Machine to Machin communication.  This sample code get Raspberry PI CPU temperature, CPU usage (load) then connect ATT M2X cloud server upload time series values.
  
  Sample time series graph can be viewed using this URL

To use this script, first need to create account (Free) from https://m2x.att.com/ and add device (Max 10 device), get the API access key and device ID and replace into script.

Execute this script in background or auto start up (whenever device boots) so any time monitor device, write a trigger events and develop anything as per need.
